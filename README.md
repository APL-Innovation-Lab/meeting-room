# Meeting Room Prototype

This is the source code for the Austin Public Library meeting room booking page code prototype.

## Development

There is a short guide for [setting up a local development environment](https://github.com/APL-Innovation-Lab/meeting-room-prototype/wiki/Setting-up-a-Local-Development-Environment) if you wish to contribute changes, fixes, and improvements to the Meeting Room prototype.

## Contributing

This prototype is built and maintained by a small team of mostly volunteers – we'd love your help to fix bugs and add features!

Before submitting a pull request, please discuss with the core team by creating or commenting in an issue on GitHub – we'd also love to hear from you in the discussions. This way we can ensure that an approach is agreed on before code is written. This will result in a much higher likelihood of your code being accepted.

If you’re looking for ways to get started, here's a list of ways to help us improve this prototype:

-   Issues with [good first issue label](https://github.com/APL-Innovation-Lab/meeting-room-prototype/labels/good%20first%20issue)
-   Developer happiness and documentation
-   Bugs and other issues listed on GitHub

<!-- ## Architecture

If you're interested in contributing or learning more about the prototype's codebase, please refer to the [architecture page](https://github.com/APL-Innovation-Lab/meeting-room-prototype/wiki/Prototype-Architecture) first for a high level overview of how the application is put together.

## Debugging

TODO: How to debug with VS Code

## Tests

We aim to have sufficient test coverage for critical parts of the prototype and aren't aiming for 100% unit test coverage.

To add new tests, write your tests with Vitest and add a file with .test.ts extension next to the tested code.

```sh
# To run all tests
make test

# To run backend tests in watch mode
make watch
Once the test database is created with make test you may individually run frontend and backend tests directly.

# To run backend tests
yarn test:server

# To run a specific backend test
yarn test:server myTestFile

# To run frontend tests
yarn test:app
``` -->
